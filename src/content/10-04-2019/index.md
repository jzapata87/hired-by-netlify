The term bookkeeping means different things to different people.

```jsx{numberLines: true}
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
      ]
    }
  }
]

function Hero() {
  return (
    <Section
      bg="#1fc8db"

    >
      <ContentContainer width={[ 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4]} mx='auto'>
        <p>Hi</p>
      </ContentContainer>
    </Section>
  );
}
```

- Many believe that bookkeeping is the same as accounting.  They assume that keeping a company's books and preparing its financial statements and tax reports are all part of bookkeeping, while others see bookkeeping as limited to recording transactions in journals or dayboooks and then posting the amounts in accounts in ledgers.
